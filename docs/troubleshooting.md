# Troubleshooting

## I can't see any action running

#### Did you install gitStream in your repo?
Check that you see gitStream app on repository's Settings > GitHub apps:

![GitHub App installed](screenshots/app_in_github.png)
In case you don't see it, visit the marketplace and install it for free: https://github.com/marketplace/gitstream-by-linearb

#### Did you set the workflow files correctly?
Check you have placed these two files in your repository with these exact names: 

1. `gitstream.cm` in the `cm` repo, (for org level installs), or `.cm/gitstream.cm` on all other repositories
2. `.github/workflows/gitstream.yml`

These files must be committed to the repository default branch (usually `master` or `main`). Notice that the action will not run until these files are found on the default branch.

Check that you see "gitStream workflow automation" in the Action section in your repository:

![GitHub action](screenshots/github_pr_actions_section.png)

Next, if you see failed action, check out the details:

![GitHub action log](screenshots/github_pr_actions_log.png)

Some organization limit which actions can run, in that case in the repository settings you should enable it:

![GitHub allow marketplace actions](screenshots/github_settings_allow_actions.png)

Also, add 
```
linear-b/gitstream-github-action@v1,*/*/.github/workflows/gitstream.yml*
``` 
to the **Allow specified actions and reusable workflows** list, if it is shown.

#### Using org level? Did you enable gitStream for your `cm` repo

Make sure you have added the `cm` repo to the repos gitStream should run on
![GitHub cm repo](screenshots/repo_in_org_setup.png)

#### Is the PR in Draft mode?

gitStream automations won't trigger for PRs that are in Draft mode.

#### I see 'gitStream workflow file not found' error

This error indicates that gitStream is unable to locate the file `.github/workflows/gitstream.yml`. The tool first searches for this file in the `cm` repository and then in the PR's repository. If the CI file is not found, this error message is displayed. To resolve this issue, ensure that your setup is correct and that the specified file exists in your repository.

## I have rules that should have blocked merge, but the PR can be merged still

For example, when using the [`set-required-approvals`](/automation-actions#set-required-approvals) 
action, gitStream can ensure the PR got enough approvals before it can be merged. gitStream does that 
by running as a check and marking the check conclusion as failed. In order for the PR to be blocked, gitStream should be set as a required check in the repo: [instructions here](/github-installation#github-merge-block).

## I can't set gitStream as required check

In order for gitStream to be listed as a required check, it needs to be triggered at least once in that repo. First create a new PR so gitStream is triggered.

Check it under repository's Settings > Branches:

![Required checks](screenshots/required_checks_in_github.png)

## I don't want gitStream to run on PRs that was generated by a bot

When using repository level rules, you can edit the `.github/workflows/gitstream.yml` and uncomment the `if` line, you can edit and replace the bot name with the bot name you want to ignore (`dependabot[bot]` in the example below).

!!! note 

    This will not work for org level rules

```yaml+jinja title=".github/workflows/gitstream.yml" hl_lines="5"
jobs:
  gitStream:
    timeout-minutes: 5
    # uncomment this condition, if you don't want any automation on dependabot PRs
    if: github.actor != 'dependabot[bot]'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: gitStream workflow automation
    steps:
      - name: Evaluate Rules
        uses: linear-b/gitstream-github-action@v1
```

## gitStream fails and I don't understand why

gitStream check run can fail from different reasons, and these are shown in the check result. 

#### Missing workflow file

When it says `gitStream.cm Skipped â€” gitStream workflow file not found`, it means that the GitHub action was not found, check again that you have this file in your repository root: `.github/workflows/gitstream.yml`, see instructions on [GitHub installation](/github-installation).

#### Syntax error in the cm files

![Check failure](screenshots/check_syntax_failure.png)

Clicking the `Details` button will show more information and context.

![Check error details](screenshots/check_syntax_failure_details.png)

You can add this automation to see details on context variable.

## How can I debug expressions and see their content?

You can dump any context value to the PR comment. For example, to see the list of changed files, use:

```yaml+jinja
automations:
  show_changed_files:
    if:
      - true
    run:
      - action: add-comment@v1
        args:
          comment: |
            FILES DUMP {{ files | dump | safe }}
            JS FILES DUMP {{ files | filter(regex=r/\.js$/) | dump | safe }}
```

<div class="result" markdown>

  <span>
  [:octicons-download-24: Download and add to your repo .cm directory](/downloads/debug.cm){ .md-button }
  </span>

</div>


## gitStream fails with syntax error after adding new rules

**IntelliJ IDEA** has automatic code styling for YAML that can break the `.cm` syntax, check the following _Settings/Preferences | Editor | Code Style | YAML --> Spaces | Code braces_ and make sure it is unchecked.

![Intellij settings](screenshots/intellij_settings_code_braces.png)

**VS Code** YAML plugin by Red Hat extension `[vscode-yaml](https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-yaml)` has automatic code styling for YAML that can break the `.cm` syntax, make sure you disable `bracketSpacing`
```json
{
    "yaml.format.bracketSpacing": false,
}
```
